# Hackerrank Solutions

These are my solutions for the challenges on 
[hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

I started with JavaScript since I'm more familiar with it, maybe there will 
be other languages as well - time will tell.

## Struture

Each challenge is stored in it's own directory with the challenge name 
derived from the url `https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/<challenge-name>` 
=> `challenge-name`.

Each directory contains test cases with input `*.in` with expected output 
`*.out`. The code will be run for each test case using `x.in` as input
and producing `x.tmp` as output, which will be compared with the stored
expected output in `x.out`.

As far as I can tell input will always be provided without a final newline
(`\n`) and output always expects ending with a newline.

Unfortunately test cases access is limited, so only the first test case 
(which is for free) is included here.

## Testing / Running the code

### JavaScript

Start (Windows)

```run-js 30-hello-world```

Start (*nix)

```./run.sh 30-hello-world```
